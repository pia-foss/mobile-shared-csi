## Documentation

#### Architecture

The library is formed by two layers. The common layer. Containing the business logic for all platforms. And, the bridging layer. Containing the platform specific logic being injected into the common layer.

Code structure via packages:

* `commonMain` - Common business logic.
* `androidMain` - Android's bridging layer, providing the platform specific dependencies.
* `iosMain` - iOS's bridging layer, providing the platform specific dependencies.

#### Significant Classes and Interfaces

* `CSIBuilder` - Public builder class responsible for creating an instance of an object conforming to `CSIAPI` interface.
* `CSIAPI` - Public interfaces defining the API to be offered by the library to the clients.
* `CSIHttpClient` - Class defining the certificate pinning logic on each platform.
